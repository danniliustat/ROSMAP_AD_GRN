MAP kinase kinase kinase subfamily","Regulation of nuclear pre-mRNA domain containing 2","SUMO-interacting motif-containing protein 1; SUMO interacting motifs containing 1","Insulin receptor; Receptor tyrosine kinase which mediates the pleiotropic actions of insulin. Binding<br>of insulin leads to phosphorylation of several intracellular substrates, including, insulin receptor<br>substrates (IRS1, 2, 3, 4), SHC, GAB1, CBL and other signaling intermediates. Each of these<br>phosphorylated proteins serve as docking proteins for other signaling proteins that contain Src-<br>homology-2 domains (SH2 domain) that specifically recognize different phosphotyrosine residues,<br>including the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K and SHP2. Phosphorylation of IRSs proteins lead to the<br>acti [...]","Nucleolar protein 10; WD repeat domain containing; Belongs to the WD repeat NOL10/ENP2 family","E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase RNF130; May have a role during the programmed cell death of hematopoietic<br>cells (By similarity).

Plays a<br>role in regulating mitochondrial function and cell proliferation. Required for protein stability of<br>MTOR and MTOR-related proteins, and cell cycle progress by growth factors","Serine/threonine-protein kinase 36; Serine/threonine protein kinase which plays an important role in<br>the sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway by regulating the activity of GLI transcription factors. Controls the<br>activity of the transcriptional regulators GLI1, GLI2 and GLI3 by opposing the effect of SUFU and<br>promoting their nuclear localization. GLI2 requires an additional function of STK36 to become<br>transcriptionally active, but the enzyme does not need to possess an active kinase catalytic site for<br>this to occur. Required for postnatal development, possibly by regulating the homeostasis of c [...]","Phosphofurin acidic cluster sorting protein 2; Multifunctional sorting protein that controls the<br>endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mitochondria communication, including the apposition of mitochondria with<br>the ER and ER homeostasis. In addition, in response to apoptic inducer, translocates BIB to<br>mitochondria, which initiates a sequence of events including the formation of mitochondrial truncated<br>BID, the release of cytochrome c, the activation of caspase-3 thereby causing cell death. May also be<br>involved in ion channel trafficking, directing acidic cluster-containing ion channels to distinct<br>[...]","GATOR complex protein WDR59; As a component of the GATOR subcomplex GATOR2, functions within the amino<br>acid-sensing branch of the TORC1 signaling pathway.

Increases degradation of beta tubulin, when overexpressed in polarized cells. Promotes epi [...]","Ras GTPase-activating-like protein IQGAP1; Binds to activated CDC42 but does not stimulate its GTPase<br>activity. It associates with calmodulin. Could serve as an assembly scaffold for the organization of a<br>multimolecular complex that would interface incoming signals to the reorganization of the actin<br>cytoskeleton at the plasma membrane.
