Controls the activity of the transcriptional regulators GLI1, GLI2 and GLI3 by<br>opposing the effect of SUFU and promoting their nuclear localization. GLI2 requires an<br>additional function of STK36 to become transcriptionally active, but the enzyme does not<br>need to possess an active kinase catalytic site for this to occur.
