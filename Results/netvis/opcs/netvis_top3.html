Produces force towards<br>the minus ends of microtubules. Dynein has ATPase activity; the force-producing power stroke is<br>thought to occur on release of ADP; Dyneins, axonemal","Catenin alpha-3; May be involved in formation of stretch-resistant cell- cell adhesion complexes;<br>Alpha catenins","Sulfatase-modifying factor 1; Using molecular oxygen and an unidentified reducing agent, oxidizes a<br>cysteine residue in the substrate sulfatase to an active site 3-oxoalanine residue, which is also<br>called C(alpha)-formylglycine. Known substrates include GALNS, ARSA, STS and ARSE; Belongs to the<br>sulfatase-modifying factor family","Biotinidase; Catalytic release of biotin from biocytin, the product of biotin-dependent carboxylases<br>degradation","Maestro heat like repeat family member 9","Caveolin-3; May act as a scaffolding protein within caveolar membranes. Interacts directly with<br>G-protein alpha subunits and can functionally regulate their activity. May also regulate voltage-gated<br>potassium channels. Plays a role in the sarcolemma repair mechanism of both skeletal muscle and<br>cardiomyocytes that permits rapid resealing of membranes disrupted by mechanical stress (By<br>similarity). Mediates the recruitment of CAVIN2 and CAVIN3 proteins to the caveolae","Serine/threonine-protein kinase MAK; Essential for the regulation of ciliary length and required for<br>the long-term survival of photoreceptors (By similarity). Phosphorylates FZR1 in a cell<br>cycle-dependent manner. Plays a role in the transcriptional coactivation of AR. Could play an<br>important function in spermatogenesis. May play a role in chromosomal stability in prostate cancer<br>cells","Filamin A-interacting protein 1-like; Acts as a regulator of the antiangiogenic activity on<br>endothelial cells. When overexpressed in endothelial cells, leads to inhibition of cell proliferation<br>and migration and an increase in apoptosis. Inhibits melanoma growth When expressed in tumor-<br>associated vasculature","Not identified in database","Not identified in database","Not identified in database","Angiopoietin-2; Binds to TEK/TIE2, competing for the ANGPT1 binding site, and modulating ANGPT1<br>signaling. Can induce tyrosine phosphorylation of TEK/TIE2 in the absence of ANGPT1. In the absence of<br>angiogenic inducers, such as VEGF, ANGPT2-mediated loosening of cell-matrix contacts may induce<br>endothelial cell apoptosis with consequent vascular regression. In concert with VEGF, it may<br>facilitate endothelial cell migration and proliferation, thus serving as a permissive angiogenic<br>signal; Fibrinogen C domain containing","Apoptosis facilitator Bcl-2-like protein 14; Plays a role in apoptosis; Belongs to the Bcl-2 family","Cytokine receptor-like factor 3; May play a role in the negative regulation of cell cycle progression;<br>Fibronectin type III domain containing","Cytosolic carboxypeptidase-like protein 5; Metallocarboxypeptidase that mediates protein<br>deglutamylation. Specifically catalyzes the deglutamylation of the branching point glutamate side<br>chains generated by post- translational glutamylation in proteins such as tubulins. In contrast, it is<br>not able to act as a long-chain deglutamylase that shortens long polyglutamate chains, a process<br>catalyzed by AGTPBP1/CCP1, AGBL2/CCP2, AGBL3/CCP3, AGBL1/CCP4 and AGBL4/CCP6. Mediates deglutamylation<br>of CGAS/MB21D1, regulating the antiviral activity of CGAS/MB21D1","Serine protease 48; Belongs to the peptidase S1 family"],"group":["non-TF & non-hub","non-TF &
