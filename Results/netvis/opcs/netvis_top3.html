Produces<br>force towards the minus ends of microtubules. Dynein has ATPase activity; the<br>force-producing power stroke is thought to occur on release of ADP; Dyneins, axonemal","Catenin alpha-3; May be involved in formation of stretch-resistant cell- cell adhesion<br>complexes; Alpha catenins","Sulfatase-modifying factor 1; Using molecular oxygen and an unidentified reducing agent,<br>oxidizes a cysteine residue in the substrate sulfatase to an active site 3-oxoalanine<br>residue, which is also called C(alpha)-formylglycine. Known substrates include GALNS, ARSA,<br>STS and ARSE; Belongs to the sulfatase-modifying factor family","Biotinidase; Catalytic release of biotin from biocytin, the product of biotin-dependent<br>carboxylases degradation","Maestro heat like repeat family member 9","Caveolin-3; May act as a scaffolding protein within caveolar membranes. Interacts directly<br>with G-protein alpha subunits and can functionally regulate their activity. May also<br>regulate voltage-gated potassium channels. Plays a role in the sarcolemma repair mechanism<br>of both skeletal muscle and cardiomyocytes that permits rapid resealing of membranes<br>disrupted by mechanical stress (By similarity). Mediates the recruitment of CAVIN2 and<br>CAVIN3 proteins to the caveolae","Serine/threonine-protein kinase MAK; Essential for the regulation of ciliary length and<br>required for the long-term survival of photoreceptors (By similarity). Phosphorylates FZR1<br>in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Plays a role in the transcriptional coactivation of AR.<br>Could play an important function in spermatogenesis. May play a role in chromosomal<br>stability in prostate cancer cells","Filamin A-interacting protein 1-like; Acts as a regulator of the antiangiogenic activity on<br>endothelial cells. When overexpressed in endothelial cells, leads to inhibition of cell<br>proliferation and migration and an increase in apoptosis. Inhibits melanoma growth When<br>expressed in tumor- associated vasculature","Not identified in database","Not identified in database","Not identified in database","Angiopoietin-2; Binds to TEK/TIE2, competing for the ANGPT1 binding site, and modulating<br>ANGPT1 signaling. Can induce tyrosine phosphorylation of TEK/TIE2 in the absence of ANGPT1.<br>In the absence of angiogenic inducers, such as VEGF, ANGPT2-mediated loosening of<br>cell-matrix contacts may induce endothelial cell apoptosis with consequent vascular<br>regression. In concert with VEGF, it may facilitate endothelial cell migration and<br>proliferation, thus serving as a permissive angiogenic signal; Fibrinogen C domain<br>containing","Apoptosis facilitator Bcl-2-like protein 14; Plays a role in apoptosis; Belongs to the Bcl-2<br>family","Cytokine receptor-like factor 3; May play a role in the negative regulation of cell cycle<br>progression; Fibronectin type III domain containing","Cytosolic carboxypeptidase-like protein 5; Metallocarboxypeptidase that mediates protein<br>deglutamylation. Specifically catalyzes the deglutamylation of the branching point glutamate<br>side chains generated by post- translational glutamylation in proteins such as tubulins. In<br>contrast, it is not able to act as a long-chain deglutamylase that shortens long<br>polyglutamate chains, a process catalyzed by AGTPBP1/CCP1, AGBL2/CCP2, AGBL3/CCP3,<br>AGBL1/CCP4 and AGBL4/CCP6. Mediates deglutamylation of CGAS/MB21D1, regulating the antiviral<br>activity of CGAS/MB21D1","Serine protease 48; Belongs to the peptidase S1
