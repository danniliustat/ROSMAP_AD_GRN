Independently of its E3<br>ligase activity, acts as a CTNNB1 stabilizer through USP7-mediated deubiquitination of<br>CTNNB1 promoting Wnt signaling; Ring finger proteins","Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule-like protein 1; Cell adhesion molecule that plays a<br>role in neuronal self-avoidance. Promotes repulsion between specific neuronal processes of<br>either the same cell or the same subtype of cells. Promotes both isoneuronal self-avoidance<br>for creating an orderly neurite arborization in retinal rod bipolar cells and heteroneuronal<br>self-avoidance to maintain mosaic spacing between AII amacrine cells (By similarity).<br>Adhesion molecule that promotes lamina-specific synaptic connections in the retina:<br>expressed in specific subsets of interneurons and retinal [...]","Guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(o) subunit alpha; Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins<br>(G proteins) are involved as modulators or transducers in various transmembrane signaling<br>systems. The G(o) protein function is not clear. Stimulated by RGS14; Belongs to the G-alpha<br>family. G(i/o/t/z) subfamily","LIM and calponin homology domains 1","PX domain-containing protein kinase-like protein; Binds to and modulates brain Na,K-ATPase<br>subunits ATP1B1 and ATP1B3 and may thereby participate in the regulation of electrical<br>excitability and synaptic transmission. May not display kinase activity","PWWP domain-containing protein 2A; H2A.Z-specific chromatin binding protein which may play<br>an important role in the neural crest stem cell migration and differentiation during early<br>development. Also required for proper mitosis progression; PWWP domain containing","Neogenin; Multi-functional cell surface receptor regulating cell adhesion in many diverse<br>developmental processes, including neural tube and mammary gland formation, myogenesis and<br>angiogenesis. Receptor for members of the BMP, netrin, and repulsive guidance molecule (RGM)<br>families. Netrin-Neogenin interactions result in a chemoattractive axon guidance response<br>and cell-cell adhesion, the interaction between NEO1/Neogenin and RGMa and RGMb induces a<br>chemorepulsive response; Belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily. DCC family","Polycomb group RING finger protein 5; Component of a Polycomb group (PcG) multiprotein PRC1-<br>like complex, a complex class required to maintain the transcriptionally repressive state of<br>many genes, including Hox genes, throughout development. PcG PRC1 complex acts via chromatin<br>remodeling and modification of histones; it mediates monoubiquitination of histone H2A<br>'Lys-119', rendering chromatin heritably changed in its expressibility. Within the PRC1-like<br>complex, regulates RNF2 ubiquitin ligase activity. Plays a redundant role with PCGF3 as part<br>of a PRC1-like complex that mediates mon [...]","Arf-GAP with GTPase, ANK repeat and PH domain-containing protein 1; GTPase-activating<br>protein for ARF1 and, to a lesser extent, ARF5. Directly and specifically regulates the<br>adapter protein 3 (AP-3)-dependent trafficking of proteins in the endosomal-lysosomal<br>system; Belongs to the centaurin gamma-like family","Nuclear receptor corepressor 2; Transcriptional corepressor. Mediates the transcriptional<br>repression activity of some nuclear receptors by promoting chromatin condensation, thus<br>preventing access of the basal transcription. Isoform 1 and isoform 5 have different<br>affinities for different nuclear receptors. Involved in the regulation BCL6-dependent of the<br>germinal center (GC) reactions, mainly through the control of the GC B-cells proliferation<br>and survival; Myb/SANT domain containing","Protein FAM222A; Family with sequence similarity 222 member A; Belongs to the FAM222 family","Transcription factor EB; Transcription factor that specifically recognizes and binds E-box<br>sequences (5'-CANNTG-3'). Efficient DNA-binding requires dimerization with itself or with<br>another MiT/TFE family member such as TFE3 or MITF. In association with TFE3, activates the<br>expression of CD40L in T-cells, thereby playing a role in T- cell-dependent antibody<br>responses in activated CD4(+) T-cells and thymus-dependent humoral immunity. Specifically<br>recognizes and binds the CLEAR-box sequence (5'-GTCACGTGAC-3') present in the regulatory<br>region of many lysosomal genes, leading to activate the [...]"],"modularity":["1","1","1","2","2","2","2","2","1","3","1","3"],"r2":[0,0.792109666344375,0.589694228051471,0.685258594374158,0.71336318277071,0.691567064031452,0.81246374838946,0,0.71034959556816,0.647608709482173,0.556058058946077,0.610690066498032],"c2":[1.26572058451321,2.59927495837057,0,2.83050868827449,null,null,null,0.733570733768411,0,0.610690066498032,null,null],"hub":["FALSE","TRUE","FALSE","TRUE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE"],"hub_class":[null,"responder",null,"driver",null,null,"responder",null,null,null,null,null],"tf":["FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","TRUE"],"group":["non-TF & non-hub","non-TF & responder","non-TF & non-hub","non-TF & driver","non-TF & non-hub","non-TF & non-hub","non-TF & non-hub","non-TF & non-hub","non-TF & non-hub","non-TF & non-hub","non-TF & non-hub","TF & non-hub"],"enrichment":["","","","","","","","","","","",""]},"edges":{"from":["RNF220","RNF220","DSCAML1","DSCAML1","DSCAML1","DSCAML1","LIMCH1","LIMCH1","LIMCH1","LIMCH1","PCGF5","NCOR2"],"to":["DSCAML1","GNAO1","LIMCH1","AGAP1","NCOR2","FAM222A","DSCAML1","PXK","PWWP2A","NEO1","NEO1","TFEB"],"arrows.to.type":["arrow","arrow","arrow","arrow","arrow","arrow","arrow","arrow","arrow","arrow","arrow","arrow"]},"nodesToDataframe":true,"edgesToDataframe":true,"options":{"width":"100%","height":"100%","nodes":{"shape":"dot"},"manipulation":{"enabled":false},"interaction":{"hover":true,"zoomSpeed":1},"layout":{"randomSeed":1},"edges":{"arrows":"to"},"groups":{"non-TF & non-hub":{"color":"#97C2FC","shape":"dot"},"TF & non-hub":{"color":"#FF7F00","shape":"dot"},"non-TF & generalhub":{"color":"#9DCE03FF","shape":"square"},"TF & generalhub":{"color":"#FF7F00","shape":"square"},"non-TF & driver":{"color":"#9DCE03FF","shape":"triangle"},"TF & driver":{"color":"#FF7F00","shape":"triangle"},"non-TF & responder":{"color":"#9DCE03FF","shape":"triangleDown"},"TF & responder":{"color":"#FF7F00","shape":"triangleDown"},"non-TF & dual":{"color":"#9DCE03FF","shape":"diamond"},"useDefaultGroups":true,"TF & dual":{"color":"#FF7F00","shape":"diamond"}}},"groups":["non-TF & non-hub","non-TF & responder","non-TF & driver","TF & non-hub"],"width":"100%","height":"1000px","idselection":{"enabled":false,"style":"width: 150px; height: 26px","useLabels":true,"main":"Select by id"},"byselection":{"enabled":true,"style":"width: 150px; height: 26px","multiple":true,"hideColor":"rgba(200,200,200,0.5)","highlight":false,"variable":"enrichment","main":"Select by enrichment","values":[]},"main":{"text":"oligodendrocytes sub-network: top 3 --selected genes","style":"font-family:Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif;font-weight:bold;font-size:20px;text-align:center;"},"submain":null,"footer":null,"background":"rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)","tooltipStay":300,"tooltipStyle":"position: fixed;visibility:hidden;padding: 5px;white-space: nowrap;font-family: verdana;font-size:14px;font-color:#000000;background-color: #f5f4ed;-moz-border-radius: 3px;-webkit-border-radius: 3px;border-radius: 3px;border: 1px solid #808074;box-shadow: 3px 3px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);","highlight":{"enabled":true,"hoverNearest":true,"degree":2,"algorithm":"all","hideColor":"rgba(200,200,200,0.5)","labelOnly":true},"collapse":{"enabled":false,"fit":false,"resetHighlight":true,"clusterOptions":null,"keepCoord":true,"labelSuffix":"(cluster)"}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
