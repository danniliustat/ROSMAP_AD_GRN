Independently of its E3 ligase activity, acts as a<br>CTNNB1 stabilizer through USP7-mediated deubiquitination of CTNNB1 promoting Wnt signaling; Ring<br>finger proteins","Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule-like protein 1; Cell adhesion molecule that plays a role in<br>neuronal self-avoidance. Promotes repulsion between specific neuronal processes of either the same<br>cell or the same subtype of cells. Promotes both isoneuronal self-avoidance for creating an orderly<br>neurite arborization in retinal rod bipolar cells and heteroneuronal self-avoidance to maintain mosaic<br>spacing between AII amacrine cells (By similarity). Adhesion molecule that promotes lamina-specific<br>synaptic connections in the retina: expressed in specific subsets of interneurons and retinal [...]","Guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(o) subunit alpha; Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G<br>proteins) are involved as modulators or transducers in various transmembrane signaling systems. The<br>G(o) protein function is not clear. Stimulated by RGS14; Belongs to the G-alpha family. G(i/o/t/z)<br>subfamily","LIM and calponin homology domains 1","PX domain-containing protein kinase-like protein; Binds to and modulates brain Na,K-ATPase subunits<br>ATP1B1 and ATP1B3 and may thereby participate in the regulation of electrical excitability and<br>synaptic transmission. May not display kinase activity","PWWP domain-containing protein 2A; H2A.Z-specific chromatin binding protein which may play an<br>important role in the neural crest stem cell migration and differentiation during early development.<br>Also required for proper mitosis progression; PWWP domain containing","Neogenin; Multi-functional cell surface receptor regulating cell adhesion in many diverse<br>developmental processes, including neural tube and mammary gland formation, myogenesis and<br>angiogenesis. Receptor for members of the BMP, netrin, and repulsive guidance molecule (RGM) families.<br>Netrin-Neogenin interactions result in a chemoattractive axon guidance response and cell-cell<br>adhesion, the interaction between NEO1/Neogenin and RGMa and RGMb induces a chemorepulsive response;<br>Belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily. DCC family","Polycomb group RING finger protein 5; Component of a Polycomb group (PcG) multiprotein PRC1- like<br>complex, a complex class required to maintain the transcriptionally repressive state of many genes,<br>including Hox genes, throughout development. PcG PRC1 complex acts via chromatin remodeling and<br>modification of histones; it mediates monoubiquitination of histone H2A 'Lys-119', rendering chromatin<br>heritably changed in its expressibility. Within the PRC1-like complex, regulates RNF2 ubiquitin ligase<br>activity. Plays a redundant role with PCGF3 as part of a PRC1-like complex that mediates mon [...]","Arf-GAP with GTPase, ANK repeat and PH domain-containing protein 1; GTPase-activating protein for ARF1<br>and, to a lesser extent, ARF5. Directly and specifically regulates the adapter protein 3<br>(AP-3)-dependent trafficking of proteins in the endosomal-lysosomal system; Belongs to the centaurin<br>gamma-like family","Nuclear receptor corepressor 2; Transcriptional corepressor. Mediates the transcriptional repression<br>activity of some nuclear receptors by promoting chromatin condensation, thus preventing access of the<br>basal transcription. Isoform 1 and isoform 5 have different affinities for different nuclear<br>receptors. Involved in the regulation BCL6-dependent of the germinal center (GC) reactions, mainly<br>through the control of the GC B-cells proliferation and survival; Myb/SANT domain containing","Protein FAM222A; Family with sequence similarity 222 member A; Belongs to the FAM222 family","Transcription factor EB; Transcription factor that specifically recognizes and binds E-box sequences<br>(5'-CANNTG-3'). Efficient DNA-binding requires dimerization with itself or with another MiT/TFE family<br>member such as TFE3 or MITF. In association with TFE3, activates the expression of CD40L in T-cells,<br>thereby playing a role in T- cell-dependent antibody responses in activated CD4(+) T-cells and<br>thymus-dependent humoral immunity. Specifically recognizes and binds the CLEAR-box sequence<br>(5'-GTCACGTGAC-3') present in the regulatory region of many lysosomal genes, leading to activate the<br>[...]"],"group":["non-TF & non-hub","non-TF & generalhub","non-TF & non-hub","non-TF & driver","non-TF & non-hub","non-TF & non-hub","non-TF & responder","non-TF & non-hub","non-TF & non-hub","non-TF & non-hub","non-TF & non-hub","TF & non-hub"],"modularity":["1","1","1","2","2","2","2","2","1","3","1","3"],"r2":[0,0.792109666344375,0.589694228051471,0.685258594374158,0.71336318277071,0.691567064031452,0.81246374838946,0,0.71034959556816,0.647608709482173,0.556058058946077,0.610690066498032],"c2":[1.26572058451321,2.59927495837057,0,2.83050868827449,null,null,null,0.733570733768411,0,0.610690066498032,null,null],"hub":["FALSE","TRUE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE"],"hub_class":[null,"generalhub",null,"driver",null,null,"responder",null,null,null,null,null],"tf":["FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","TRUE"],"enrichment":["","","","","","","","","","","",""]},"edges":{"from":["RNF220","RNF220","DSCAML1","DSCAML1","DSCAML1","DSCAML1","LIMCH1","LIMCH1","LIMCH1","LIMCH1","PCGF5","NCOR2"],"to":["DSCAML1","GNAO1","LIMCH1","AGAP1","NCOR2","FAM222A","DSCAML1","PXK","PWWP2A","NEO1","NEO1","TFEB"],"arrows.to.type":["arrow","arrow","arrow","arrow","arrow","arrow","arrow","arrow","arrow","arrow","arrow","arrow"]},"nodesToDataframe":true,"edgesToDataframe":true,"options":{"width":"100%","height":"100%","nodes":{"shape":"dot"},"manipulation":{"enabled":false},"interaction":{"hover":true,"zoomSpeed":1},"layout":{"randomSeed":1},"edges":{"arrows":"to"},"groups":{"non-TF & non-hub":{"color":"#97C2FC","shape":"dot"},"TF & non-hub":{"color":"#D8527CFF","shape":"dot"},"non-TF & generalhub":{"color":"#9DCE03FF","shape":"square"},"TF & generalhub":{"color":"#D8527CFF","shape":"square"},"non-TF & driver":{"color":"#9DCE03FF","shape":"triangle"},"TF & driver":{"color":"#D8527CFF","shape":"triangle"},"non-TF & responder":{"color":"#9DCE03FF","shape":"triangleDown"},"TF & responder":{"color":"#D8527CFF","shape":"triangleDown"},"non-TF & bowtie":{"color":"#9DCE03FF","shape":"diamond"},"useDefaultGroups":true,"TF & bowtie":{"color":"#D8527CFF","shape":"diamond"}}},"groups":["non-TF & non-hub","non-TF & generalhub","non-TF & driver","non-TF & responder","TF & non-hub"],"width":"100%","height":"1000px","idselection":{"enabled":false,"style":"width: 150px; height: 26px","useLabels":true,"main":"Select by id"},"byselection":{"enabled":true,"style":"width: 150px; height: 26px","multiple":true,"hideColor":"rgba(200,200,200,0.5)","highlight":false,"variable":"enrichment","main":"Select by enrichment","values":[]},"main":{"text":"oligodendrocytes sub-network: top 3 --selected genes","style":"font-family:Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif;font-weight:bold;font-size:20px;text-align:center;"},"submain":null,"footer":null,"background":"rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)","tooltipStay":300,"tooltipStyle":"position: fixed;visibility:hidden;padding: 5px;white-space: nowrap;font-family: verdana;font-size:14px;font-color:#000000;background-color: #f5f4ed;-moz-border-radius: 3px;-webkit-border-radius: 3px;border-radius: 3px;border: 1px solid #808074;box-shadow: 3px 3px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);","highlight":{"enabled":true,"hoverNearest":true,"degree":2,"algorithm":"all","hideColor":"rgba(200,200,200,0.5)","labelOnly":true},"collapse":{"enabled":false,"fit":false,"resetHighlight":true,"clusterOptions":null,"keepCoord":true,"labelSuffix":"(cluster)"}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
