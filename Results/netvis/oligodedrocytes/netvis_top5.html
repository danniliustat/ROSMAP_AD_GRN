Necessary for<br>utilization of methylgroups from the folate cycle, thereby affecting transgenerational epigenetic<br>inheritance. Folate pathway donates methyl groups necessary for cellular methylation and affects<br>different pathways such as DNA methylation, possibly explaining the transgenerational epigenetic<br>inheritance effects","SRC kinase signaling inhibitor 1; Acts as a negative regulator of SRC by activating CSK which inhibits<br>SRC activity and downstream signaling, leading to impaired cell spreading and migration. Regulates<br>dendritic spine morphology. Involved in calcium-dependent exocytosis. May play a role in<br>neurotransmitter release or synapse maintenance","Unconventional myosin-Id; Myosins are actin-based motor molecules with ATPase activity. Unconventional<br>myosins serve in intracellular movements. Their highly divergent tails are presumed to bind to<br>membranous compartments, which would be moved relative to actin filaments (By similarity); Myosins,<br>class I","Functions as a negative regulator of MYRF in oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination.<br>Interacts with the C-terminal of MYRF inhibiting MYRF self-cleavage and N-fragment nuclear<br>translocation. The secreted form promotes differentiation of T helper 1 cells (Th1).","Dynamin-2; Microtubule-associated force-producing protein involved in producing microtubule bundles<br>and able to bind and hydrolyze GTP. Plays a role in the regulation of neuron morphology, axon growth<br>and formation of neuronal growth cones (By similarity). Plays an important role in vesicular<br>trafficking processes, in particular endocytosis. Involved in cytokinesis. Regulates maturation of<br>apoptotic cell corpse-containing phagosomes by recruiting PIK3C3 to the phagosome membrane (By<br>similarity); Pleckstrin homology domain containing","Sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 5; Receptor for the lysosphingolipid sphingosine 1- phosphate (S1P).<br>S1P is a bioactive lysophospholipid that elicits diverse physiological effect on most types of cells<br>and tissues. Is coupled to both the G(i/0)alpha and G(12) subclass of heteromeric G-proteins (By<br>similarity).
