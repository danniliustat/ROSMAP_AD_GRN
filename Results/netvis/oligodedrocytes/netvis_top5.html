Necessary for utilization of methylgroups from the folate cycle, thereby affecting<br>transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. Folate pathway donates methyl groups necessary for<br>cellular methylation and affects different pathways such as DNA methylation, possibly<br>explaining the transgenerational epigenetic inheritance effects","SRC kinase signaling inhibitor 1; Acts as a negative regulator of SRC by activating CSK<br>which inhibits SRC activity and downstream signaling, leading to impaired cell spreading and<br>migration. Regulates dendritic spine morphology. Involved in calcium-dependent exocytosis.<br>May play a role in neurotransmitter release or synapse maintenance","Unconventional myosin-Id; Myosins are actin-based motor molecules with ATPase activity.<br>Unconventional myosins serve in intracellular movements. Their highly divergent tails are<br>presumed to bind to membranous compartments, which would be moved relative to actin<br>filaments (By similarity); Myosins, class I","Functions as a negative regulator of MYRF in oligodendrocyte differentiation and<br>myelination. Interacts with the C-terminal of MYRF inhibiting MYRF self-cleavage and<br>N-fragment nuclear translocation. The secreted form promotes differentiation of T helper 1<br>cells (Th1).","Dynamin-2; Microtubule-associated force-producing protein involved in producing microtubule<br>bundles and able to bind and hydrolyze GTP. Plays a role in the regulation of neuron<br>morphology, axon growth and formation of neuronal growth cones (By similarity). Plays an<br>important role in vesicular trafficking processes, in particular endocytosis. Involved in<br>cytokinesis. Regulates maturation of apoptotic cell corpse-containing phagosomes by<br>recruiting PIK3C3 to the phagosome membrane (By similarity); Pleckstrin homology domain<br>containing","Sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 5; Receptor for the lysosphingolipid sphingosine 1-<br>phosphate (S1P). S1P is a bioactive lysophospholipid that elicits diverse physiological<br>effect on most types of cells and tissues. Is coupled to both the G(i/0)alpha and G(12)<br>subclass of heteromeric G-proteins (By similarity).
